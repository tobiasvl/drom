DRÖM
====

DRÖM ("DREAM" in Swedish) is an emulator for the DREAM 6800 home computer, powered by [LÖVE](https://love2d.org). It's a work in progress.

History
-------

The DREAM 6800 (Domestic Recreational Educational and Adaptive Microcomputer) was a Motorola 6800-based microcomputer created by Michael J. Bauer. Its construction was detailed in _Electronics Australia_ in 1979, and it included a monitor program called CHIPOS (Compact Hexadecimal Interpretive Programming and Operating System). It had its own newsletter, [DREAMER](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22N.S.W.+6800+Users+Group%22), published between 1980 and 1982. You can read more about the DREAM's history on Michael's official [DREAM 6800 Archive Site](http://www.mjbauer.biz/DREAM6800.htm).

Requirements
------------

When it's done, I will release executables. Until then, running it requires the following:

* [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) (developed with version 11.3, but probably runs on older versions)
* [love-imgui](https://github.com/slages/love-imgui)
